airplane  F9 e  Wild times  We \\x92 re being extra paranoid  Maximizing probability of successful launch is paramount  Welcome anytime Well  I do care very much about sustainability of civilization  but there is some truth to the irony part haha Yes  in plan  Superchargers and public high power wall c  U0001F440 I think so Doing range testing now  Number will be significantly higher than 300  Extreme  We have reduced pricing on Model Y LR dual motor  will offer a LR single moto  Yes It may be able to reach 250kW at low states of charge No  as range would be unacceptably low   250 mile EPA  We had to increase some wire thicknesses in S  X to reduce resistive heating  Technically    Thanks  That is the nearterm danger of AI I didn \\x92 t mind DA2  DA1 was awesome  Mass Effect 2  talking about sequels  is amazing  Haha Maybe he should design flag of Mars 48 65 78 20 74 6f 20 74 65 78 74  I spoke with Korolev \\x92 s family today  He was one of the very best  U041A U043E U0440 U043E U043B U044C U043E U0432  U041A U043E U0440 U043E U043B U0451 U0432  In general  we need to improve how podcasts play SPQR  True haha Death is the loss of information Earning power post augmentation would easily pay for itself  if that \\x92  Absolutely U0001F440 Probably a good one to design  engineer in Germany Even more Ok U0001F440 Berlin Model Y is the one to watch  That is a revolution in automotive body engineering  finally   True Wow  IHOP  GitHub are close Best use of the term \\x93 Full Stack \\x94  For sure  This is both great  terrifying  Everything we \\x92 ve ever sensed or thought has been  Yes Sorry  should hopefully be soon  Not actually a payout  just a vesting of stock options  It may never pay out  as the stock can \\x92 t b  No easy way to answer this in a tweet  but helping with dire brain injuries is our first priority  Details Aug 28  AI symbiosis while u wait There \\x92 s some of that too True  it sounds so surreal  but the negative propaganda is still all out there  easy to find in social me  Make sure to read ur terms  conditions before clicking accept  Samwise Gamgee Altho Dumb and Dumber is U0001F525 U0001F525 Progress update August 28'"
